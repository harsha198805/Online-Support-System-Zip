# Online Support System
2025-06-22

The users table has a role column used to identify user types (e.g., agent).

Only authenticated users with the role agent are allowed to access agent-related routes.

Laravel's default authentication system is being used (auth middleware is applied).

Email configuration is assumed to be set in the .env file before testing.

Improvements Implemented

This project follows the Service and Repository Pattern to keep code clean, testable, and maintainable.

Created a custom AgentMiddleware to restrict access to agent-only routes.

Applied role-based access control using middleware.

Made the dashboard responsive for mobile users by fixing Bootstrap navbar toggle behavior.

Added filters (status, customer name search, date range) with auto-submit using jQuery.

Added a reset button for filters to clear query parameters.

Added color-coded status badges (Opened, Pending) using Bootstrap styling.

Made tables mobile-friendly with table-responsive.
